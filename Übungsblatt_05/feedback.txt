Exercise 1:
	Correct.
	You could simplify sum(keyOccurences.values()) to len(S) which might
	be faster.

Exercise 2:
	Correct

Exercise 3:
	Correct

create_random_universe_subset:
	"Write a function estimate_c_for_multiple_sets which randomly
	generates a given number n of key sets with a given size k
	(no duplicates inside one set of keys!)"
	While this states that a key set may only contain unique keys
	there is no need for unique key sets.

	So the create_random_universe_subset can be simplified to:
	create_random_universe_subset(k, u):
		return random.sample(range(u), k)

Exercise 4:
	Correct
