Test with c-universal hash function:
HashFunction: a * x + b mod 101 mod 100
Size of key sets = 20 out of universe range(0,100)
Number of key sets = 1000
Mean	min	max
0.0	0.0	0.0
-----------------------------------------------
Test with non-universal hash function:
HashFunction: a * x + b mod 10 mod 100
Size of key sets = 20 out of universe range(0,100)
Number of key sets = 1000
Mean	min	max
5.0	5.0	5.0

C-Universal:
It makes sense that in a set of 1000 Hashfunctions, there is at least one, that gets us a minimum meanBucketSize of 1, which results in c=0.
The result also shows that even for a very large number of key sets, there is always at least one hash function that gives us a c of 0.

Non-C-Universal:
It is obvious, that a hash function, that maps to a hash tabel on the basis of mod 10 can never get a smaller MeanBucketSize than 2 (because the number of keys k=20).
And because c = (MeanBucketSize - 1) * m/len(S)
c can never get smaller that 5, which explains the above result.
