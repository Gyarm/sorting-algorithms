Exercise 1:
Number of operations: (worst case)
	Quicksort: Correct
	Non-Universal hash map: Correct

Number of block operations:
	Quicksort: Correct
	Non-Universal hash map: Correct

Which one is faster?: Correct

Exercise 2:
	Correct

Exercise 3:
	Correct

Exercise 4:
	Since your quicksort implementation runs on python the execution has some
	management overhead. This might include list bound checking and call-stack
	overhead. Additional to this quicksort has a minimum runtime of O(n log n)
	which scales with your sample size function (2^n).
	This results in f(n) = 2^n log 2^n = 2^n * n * log 2.
	If you compare this to universal hashing with f(n) = 2^n the difference
	should be clear.
